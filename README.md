This was my solo final project built during coding bootcamp at Flatiron school.

## About the App:

This app was built with a goal to save managers' time while writing their team's schedule in a weekly basis. It saves time because it has shifts auto generating feature which means, with a click of a button, managers can have their employees shifts ready for whatever week they needed for. 

## Technology used

The app was built using following technologies:

* React/Redux
* React library - dateFns
* Javascript ES6
* React bootstrap, CSS, Material UI
* Rails API

### `app features`

* Secure login/logout.
* Drag and Drop shifts for editting shifts.
* copy and paste whole week shifts from a previous week to present and future week.
* Navigate to a schedule for particular week through week selection.
* Change/update employees availability.
* Add/remove an employee.
* Shows events or holidays scheduled for the week for which the schedule is being created for managers to have better planning.
